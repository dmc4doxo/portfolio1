Hi John
First I usually try to do the project myself without following your video... when I get stuck, I eaither download the resource of the part to guide me or I just copy what you have and try to learn from my mistakes.

With this project, it is a bit hard since there is no resource per portion... and sometimes, we go back and add to global and come down to a segment again.

Also, I have tried to implement the way I think makes sense for me. For example, instead of using hero-img, I copied the same but did about-img. Less confusing at my level.

So, after I scrapped everything that I did over the last 3 days (it just got too messy and nothing was working anymore). I have now started to follow your video on the about. Still, I am doing exactly the same but getting different result. Case and point: stuck at the photo of about. It wont move to the center. Why???
I did inspect on chrome and it says image is justify center... but image is in fact justify left.
:-) I don't think I am meant to be a front end dev person.  
Anyway, this is my first html/css class. Please bear with me a bit.
Thanks,
Mack
====UPDATE====
By adding "Display grid" to about-img,
I was able to do the justify-self to center.

I have advance to exactly where I was yesterday. My offset borderline goes crazy at the bottom. So, I am back exactly where I was in the last two days.
Please tale a look. Thanks
====UPDATE @ 12:28pm======
Finally working.
I have to rename my "about-info" to be about-info-index"

Remove conflict with about-info for the other about page.
https://html-css-portfolio-css-grid-project.netlify.app/about.html

It is confusing to have two distinct sections called "About". So, I have About-Index and About.html. They are different

I will continue and I am sure many more challenges...
The sad thing is that I am not sure I learn much from these trouble. I just understood that centering and justifying elements is not as simple as the course make it sound :-). Sometimes, they don't work and there is no logical (that I know of) reasons for it.  
Coz... even if I had the element styled in about-info, why didn't it allow me to overide?

Anyway, thank you for helping me go thru this. I am sure more to come.

=== UPDATE 5/8/2022====
Project Section:

This section is working with everything when the screen size is above 676px approx. Below that value, all the styllings disappear. I have not yet setup @media so I am very confuse why this behavior.
Now, I now sure if I should proceed to setup the Large screen stying with this bug...

===== UPDATE 2 === 5/8/2022

I went ahead with styling for large screen at 1170px min... that works fines...but my bug with very small screen size is still there... size below 600px and almost all sty;ing disappear.
---ANY HELP WILL BE APPRECIATED----

===== UPDATE 3 === 5/8/2022
Styling bug fixed!
closing curly braces missing for 2 @media elements.
--- footer issue also seemed solved!
Back on-track...
===== End of 5/8/2022===
